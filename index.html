            <p>Daisy Trejo-Hernandez is a Florida-based student studying at the University of Central Florida (UCF). With a penchant for going down rabbit holes and a love for obscure art, Daisy's curiosity knows no bounds. While she once dreamt of being an astronomer, her dislike for physics led her to explore other passions. A fan of documentaries and a lover of learning, Daisy finds joy in expanding her knowledge. She is particularly drawn to Gothic Architecture and indulges her fascination with stationery and pens. With an insatiable thirst for exploration and a deep appreciation for the arts, Daisy's journey is one of continual growth and intellectual discovery.</p>
